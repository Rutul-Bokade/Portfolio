# Portfolio
🚀 Finance Business Analyst Portfolio 🏦📊 "I don’t play the odds—I make them."  This portfolio isn’t just about data—it’s about strategy, precision, and results. I extract insights with SQL, predict risks with Python, and build real-time dashboards that drive decisions. Finance is about power and foresight—I don’t follow trends, I anticipate them.
